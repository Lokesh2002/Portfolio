            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Lokeshwer  </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Chennai, India.</span>
            <br />I am an entry-level software engineer with a B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering.
            <br />
             I recently completed an internship as a Scripting Engineer at Fiserv, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in scripting and web development.

Alongside my internship, I have been focusing on learning and developing interactive products, honing my skills in creating innovative and user-centric solutions. My goal is to continue improving my technical expertise and evolve as a software engineer, with a strong emphasis on building scalable and efficient products.

Iâ€™m always eager to explore new technologies and challenges that will help me grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to any project I work on.
